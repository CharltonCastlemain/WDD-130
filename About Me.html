    <h2>Charlton Castlemain</h2>

    <p>Nice to meet you all! I'm an accounting major trying to finish up my degree. I am recently engaged, and will actually be getting married the last week of the semester. 
        I love BYU-Idaho because of the spirit that is on the campus, which doesn't seem to be pervaded by the marxism that seems to be prevalent in other schools. 
        I can't wait to see your different websites that are going to be different than mine.
